     		   Thank you for visiting my website! I am currently a sophomore at Harvard College living in Dunster House passionate about physics, computer science, music, and so much more. In high school, I was heavily involved in biology research, developing a new compound with applications to help treat obesity and diabetes alongside current therapeutics. In college, I am passionate about researching physics and engineering, and am currently involved in a team aiming to launch a Cubesat into space for research and testing purposes. As elaborated below, I feel that space exploration represents a final frontier for human ambition, one that can unite people from around the world in a common, inspiring human goal.

            During my free time, I was also involved in music performance, pursuing my love of piano at the Manhattan School of Music. Continuing the love of making music alongside like-minded peers, I am currently heavily involved in a music group called the Harvard Radcliffe Collegium, which collaborates with various professional groups such as Odyssey Opera to put on major productions and performances. During my free time, I also enjoy running, and plan on running a full marathon by the end of summer 2019.

          <p>
          The obesity pandemic exacerbates the risk for various deadly comorbidities including Type II Diabetes (T2DM). Current obesity and T2DM drugs are nonviable because they are ineffective or toxic. One class of antidiabetic drugs called TZDs successfully improves insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics by augmenting the activity of PPARγ, a protein regulating fat function. However, TZDs cause side effects ranging from weight gain to bone loss. This study reassessed PPARγ as an obesity and T2DM drug target by exploring distinctions between PPARγ’s two versions, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. Data showed that PPARγ2 induced fat development and caused TZDs side effects. Conversely, PPARγ1 reduced fat development. Subsequently, a drug was designed to partially inhibit PPARγ2 activity without interfering with PPARγ1. Experiments revealed that PPARγ2 activity, but not PPARγ1 activity, was reduced. Ultimately, this novel drug discriminates between each isoform’s function and may prove effective in improving TZD treatments and combating obesity.
