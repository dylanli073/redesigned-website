          <br><br>
     		   I am currently a sophomore at Harvard College living in Dunster House who is passionate about physics, computer science, music, and so much more. In high school, I was heavily involved in biology research, developing a new compound with applications to help treat obesity and diabetes alongside current therapeutics. In college, I am passionate about researching physics and engineering, and am currently involved in a team aiming to launch a Cubesat into space for research and testing purposes. As elaborated below, I feel that space exploration represents a final frontier for human ambition, one that can unite people from around the world in a common, inspiring human goal. 
           <p>
            During my free time, I was also involved in music performance, pursuing my love of piano at the Manhattan School of Music. Continuing the love of making music alongside like-minded peers, I am currently heavily involved in a music group called the Harvard Radcliffe Collegium, which collaborates with various professional groups such as Odyssey Opera to put on major productions and performances. During my free time, I also enjoy running, and plan on running a full marathon by the end of summer 2019.

          In the future, I hope to be working in academia towards a professorship in physics or engineering. I specifically want to work to develop a community around space exploration, propulsion systems, communication systems, and embedded systems to launch rockets deep into space. Read more about my ambitions and my passions below if you're curious!

          <p class="projectsTitles">A New Approach to Obesity Treatments</p>
          <p>
          The obesity pandemic exacerbates the risk for various deadly comorbidities including Type II Diabetes (T2DM). Current obesity and T2DM drugs are nonviable because they are ineffective or toxic. One class of antidiabetic drugs called TZDs successfully improves insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetics by augmenting the activity of PPARγ, a protein regulating fat function. However, TZDs cause side effects ranging from weight gain to bone loss. This study reassessed PPARγ as an obesity and T2DM drug target by exploring distinctions between PPARγ’s two versions, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2. Data showed that PPARγ2 induced fat development and caused TZDs side effects. Conversely, PPARγ1 reduced fat development. Subsequently, a drug was designed to partially inhibit PPARγ2 activity without interfering with PPARγ1. Experiments revealed that PPARγ2 activity, but not PPARγ1 activity, was reduced. Ultimately, this novel drug discriminates between each isoform’s function and may prove effective in improving TZD treatments and combating obesity.

          <p>
            Genetic background largely contributes to the complexity of metabolic responses and dysfunctions. Induction of brown adipose features in white fat, known as brown remodeling, has been appreciated as a promising strategy to offset the positive energy balance in obesity and further to improve metabolism. We discovered a new fat depot in mice that may confer several benefits for patients with obesity and diabetes. If we can make all fat depots healthier by modeling them based on this novel fat depot, we may have a stronger understanding of how to treat and target obesity on the clinical side.

          <p>
            As one of the world’s leading tourist destinations, Paris faces congestion of tourism at its center. This congestion concentrates economic benefits in the center of the city, further perpetuating the socioeconomic divide between various suburbs and Paris intra muros. To help address these issues, Portes de Paris provides locally-led walking tours based at the former gates of Paris, where the wall of the city dividing Paris from the suburbs once stood. These tours will start at the former gates and educate people about the past and future of the surrounding areas through augmented reality, and also showcase the present though walking tours led by local tour guides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired by tropical ecosystems that evolve to support diverse and robust communities, Portes de Paris aims to create a diverse collection of local tourist destinations in Paris that will showcase the various stories of the city. Through collaborations with historians, city planners, locals, and small businesses, our unique tour experience will simultaneously promote economic development and help to bridge the divide between Paris intra muros and the suburbs.

            In order to extend the bounds of human exploration, multiple steps are needed. Firstly, there must be new sustainable engineering of biological systems to counteract the effects of microgravity and radiation. Secondly, there needs to be a sustainable biohabitat on Mars. Thirdly, the amount of fuel required for such a mission right now makes the possibility of large scale travel relatively impossible. Fourthly, there exists a big stigma against traveling in space in general, especially with limited amounts of funding. In order to extend the bounds of human exploration, multiple steps are needed.

Thirdly, the amount of fuel required for such a mission right now makes the possibility of large scale travel relatively impossible. Fourthly, there exists a big stigma against traveling in space in general, especially with limited amounts of funding. Fifthly, the ultimate goal is not to travel to Mars but to travel beyond as well -- becoming an interstellar civilization requires that the fear of space be overcome and requires innovating with new technologies. 
            <p>
            Over the next few decades, I plan on designing a startup that perfects the use of robots for space colonization and development, such that one day space may become more democratized. Furthermore, I hope that by creating new propulsion systems, we can create new hope for long-term and long-distance expeditions to planets far away that may hold the key to life. Currently, a team at Harvard and I are planning to launch a CubeSat into space on a model rocket, and are hoping to understand the mechanics of sending up such a system to space.

            <p class="projectsTitles">Marathon Challenge</p>
              This past year, I have been working on running longer and longer distances as a personal goal of mine. I hope that by the end of the summer of 2019, I can do a bike tour down the California coast and run a full marathon in San Francisco. My average pace over 10 miles is ~7:00/mile, and I hope to be able to carry that pace over longer distances.
