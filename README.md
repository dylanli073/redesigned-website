# personalwebsite

This is a personal website still in development. Features in the future will include a section detailing my philosophies and my travels. The website will also include links to new apps that I make because I like money(ish) and I need advertising revenue. Finally I will probably also provide a link to all the memes I enjoy because memes = bae <3. 

A new version of the website that was uploaded to Github in July--previous version ran into multiple issues with staging and it seemed much simpler to just create a new project
