# personalwebsite

This is a personal website still in development. Features in the future will include a section detailing my philosophies and my travels. The website will also include links to new apps that I make because I like money(ish) and I need advertising revenue. Finally I will probably also provide a link to all the memes I enjoy because memes = bae <3. 

A new version of the website that was uploaded to Github in July--previous version ran into multiple issues with staging and it seemed much simpler to just create a new project

This website is still being worked on, but is being hosted live at https://salty-island-77202.herokuapp.com/ for those willing to stick with me while I work on a few Youtube Videos and blog information to host on the site. A few features are missing such as mobile support and email functionality, but will be added in the coming days.
